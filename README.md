TUTORIAL
The colors you can pick varies between different color spaces/bases. HEX, HSL and RGB. Simply click one of the buttons that displays the colors to copy it to the clipboard.
You can also right click on those buttons to directly copy CSS properties as well as plain numbers.

There are three settings.
1) Lower Case - Forces the hex color code to always be lower case
2) Auto Zoom - Automatically turns on and off the zoom feature when you start picking a color
3) Auto start app with windows - It... Speaks for itself

The little rectangle left of "pick color" can be clicked to pick from a color picker, in case you need to do that.
The Pick Color button initiates the core feature of the app. It doesn't  remove hover effects, which is by design. It means you can pick more accurately at something that's on your screen.
The zoom button manually initiates the zoom feature.

There's also a little menu at the bottom right with links and the ability to exit the app.

TECHNICAL
App was made using Forms with C# .NET.

Updates on the zoom and color picker itself is set to around once every 160 milliseconds. So it appears laggy, but i used a slightly fancier GDI, so it's not like real time updates were going to be smooth for the pointer or anything if it had been lower

App was tested on a screen with a 1x pixel ratio, 1920x1080 and a computer that was modern about 6 or more years ago. Aside from some wonkiness that could happen with the zoom feature on other pixel ratios, i don't see why any computer wouldn't be able to run this app.

IN CONCLUSION
I feature creeped quite a bit when making this. Once you get in the zone, it's easy to lose track. But now it's finished and i had fun. Feel free to fork and improve. Or suggest features or give criticisms on my socials. I'm always open to hear other people out.

Hope you find the tool useful and lightweight. See you around!
